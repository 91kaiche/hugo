You can process your CoffeeScript with `resources.Coffee`. It takes two arguments: The resource object, and an optional dictionary variable with the entries listed below. Coffee relies on the [coffeescript cli](https://coffeescript.org/#cli).


{{% note %}}
Hugo Pipe's Coffee requires the `coffeescript` package to be installed in the project or globally (`npm install -g coffeescript`).

If you are using the Hugo Snap package, Coffee requires to be installed locally within your Hugo site directory, e.g., `npm install coffeescript --save-dev` without the `-g` flag.

### Options

outputPath [string]
: Path of the newly compiled javascript file. By default, it's the original coffee file ending with .js instead. 

inlineMap [bool]
: Include the source map directly in the compiled JavaScript file (false by default).

bare [bool]
: Compile the JavaScript without the [top-level function safety wrapper](https://coffeescript.org/#lexical-scope) (false by default).

noHeader [bool]
: Suppress the “Generated by CoffeeScript” header (false by default).

### Examples

```go-html-template
{{- $transpiled := resources.Get "scripts/main.coffee" | coffee  -}}

{{ $opts := dict "outputPath" "js/main.js" }}
{{- $transpiled := resources.Get "scripts/main.coffee" | coffee $opts -}}
```

```go-html-template
{{- $transpiled := resources.Get "scripts/main.coffee" | coffee -}}
<script>{{- $transpiled.Content | safeJS -}}</script>
```
