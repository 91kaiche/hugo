Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/spf13/hugo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/spf13/hugo)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nHugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].\r\nIt is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability.\r\nHugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.\r\n\r\nHugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data.\r\nAnd you can run Hugo from any directory.\r\nThis works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.\r\n\r\nHugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.\r\nA good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.\r\n\r\nHugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.\r\n\r\n#### Supported Architectures\r\n\r\nCurrently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OS&nbsp;X (Darwin) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.\r\n\r\nHugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan&nbsp;9 and Solaris.\r\n\r\n**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation][].**\r\n\r\n## Choose How to Install\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.\r\nThe Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should [fork the Hugo GitHub project](https://github.com/spf13/hugo#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can install the Hugo source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.\r\nBuilding the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.\r\n\r\n### Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)\r\n\r\nUse the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/).\r\n\r\n### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)\r\n\r\nAdd Hugo and its package dependencies to your go `src` directory.\r\n\r\n    go get -v github.com/spf13/hugo\r\n\r\nOnce the `get` completes, you should find your new `hugo` (or `hugo.exe`) executable sitting inside `$GOPATH/bin/`.\r\n\r\nTo update Hugo’s dependencies, use `go get` with the `-u` option.\r\n\r\n    go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo\r\n\r\n## Contributing to Hugo\r\n\r\nFor a complete guide to contributing to Hugo, see the [Contribution
